# parallel-computing
a collection of parallel computing code projects

**Lab 01** is a collection of small CUDA projects inclduing 1D stencil using various memory types, and GPU-based matrix multiplication

**Lab 02** is two projects with OpenMP. One project is to implement parallel prefix sum with OpenMP using static and dynamic scheduling strategies, the other project is to parallelize the quake.c serial program.

**Lab 03** is a few projects with MPI, including a few implementations of MPI ring with blocking, non-blocking, and communicator splitting, also an implementation of MPI collective communication with broadcast and scatter-gather.

**Lab 04** is one project with Cilk+, this is a shared-memory parallel program that solves the N queens problem.

**Lab 05** is a project with TBB where the original lab5_tbb.cpp is parallelized with parallel_for to speedup the computation.
