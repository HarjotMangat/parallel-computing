# parallel-computing
a collection of parallel computing code projects

Lab 01 is a collection of small CUDA projects inclduing 1D stencil using various memory types, and GPU-based matrix multiplication

Lab 02 is two projects with OpenMP. One project is to implement parallel prefix sum with OpenMP using static and dynamic scheduling strategies, the other project is to parallelize the quake.c serial program.

Lab 03 is a few projects with MPI, including a few implementations of MPI ring with blocking, non-blocking, and communicator splitting, also an implementation of MPI collective communication with broadcast and scatter-gather.

Lab 04 is one project with Cilk+, this is a shared-memory parallel program that solves the N queens problem.

Lab 05 is a project with TBB where the original lab5_tbb.cpp is parallelized with parallel_for to speedup the computation.
